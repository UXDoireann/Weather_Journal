# Weather-Journal App Project

## **Overview**
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree Program to practice retrieving data from an API and using Asynchronous Javascript.  A starter folder was provided by Udacity.

## **Key Points of Project Completed**
- Setting up a project environment on the server.js file using node in the terminal
- Adding a GET route that returns the 'projectData' object in the server code and adding a POST route that adds incoming data to  
  projectData.
- Acquiring API credentials on Open Weather App and creating a dynamic url to retrieve data using a zip code.
- Chaining a promise to that makes a POST request to send user input and API data to the app.
- Chaining another promise to dynamically update the UI with user input and weather data.

##**Extras**
- Additional chained promise to scroll the updated UI into view
- Additional chained promise to put image in background in div of updated UI
- Styling and text content in HTML & CSS changed to 'Wuthering Heights' themed UI.

#**Weathering/Wuthering Heights**
Wuthering Heights is a gothic romance novel written in 1847 by Emile Bronte set in the Yorkshire moors about a turbulent, tragic romance, in which the deceased Catherine Earnshaw's ghost regularly appears to her lover, the tormented Heathcliff. 
It featured as the inspiration for Kate Bush's 1978 hit song of the same name.
